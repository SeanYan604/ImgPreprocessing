This package contains the Matlab implementation of our face
preprocessing pipeline, local ternary pattern feature set and distance
transform-based similarity metric. See the following two papers for
details:

[1] X.Tan and B.Triggs.  Enhanced Local Texture Feature Sets for Face
Recognition under Difficult Lighting Conditions, In Proceedings of the
2007 IEEE International Workshop on Analysis and Modeling of Faces and
Gestures (AMFG'07),LNCS 4778, pp.168-182, 2007.

[2] X.Tan and B.Triggs.  Fusing Gabor and LBP Feature Sets for
Kernel-based Face Recognition, In Proceedings of the 2007 IEEE
International Workshop on Analysis and Modeling of Faces and Gestures
(AMFG'07),,LNCS 4778, pp.235-249, 2007.

To start, run demo.m. Also refer to contents.m for a brief description
of the files in this directory. If you only want the preprocessing
routine it is in preproc2.m.
